	<h5><p> Asking good questions is very important. I have known this my whole life. If you can not ask good questions, you cannot recieve good answers. And if you cannot recieve good answers, you do not have good information.




</p>

  <br><p> My father has always been someone to ask all the questions: "Where are you going, with who, when will you be back, do you have your phone, do you have a sweater?" is his usual. And believe me it annoyed me big time. But I have to give it to him, he gets all the information he needs. And now I seem to have adopted his ablilty to ask tons of questions.



</p>

  <br><p> But asking 10 questions for one event is impractical, and annoying for the recieving party. To the best way to ask questions is still out there. And to ask the best questions you have to learn the best format for questions. My format is this:
  <br> WHEN (are is will) THING (verb) (ACCOMPLISH?!) (DATE)
  <br> or
  <br> HOW (verb) PERSON or ITEM (verb) THING (do this) even when... xx


</p>

  <br> <p> This is what I found online about asking questions, and I don't know how I feel about it; 
  <br> Before asking a technical question by e-mail, or in a newsgroup, or on a website chat board, do the following:

Try to find an answer by searching the archives of the forum you plan to post to.

Try to find an answer by searching the Web.

Try to find an answer by reading the manual.

Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ.

Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.

Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend.

If you're a programmer, try to find an answer by reading the source code.
