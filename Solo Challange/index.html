		<div class="ruby_info"> Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.

		According to its authors, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and imperative. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.

		<p>Ruby is an object oriented programming language. Everything in Ruby is an object, so Ruby is an object oriented language in the purest sense of the word. It isn't like C++ or C# where you have object types and value types, or even Java where most things are objects and a few native types must be "boxed" in order to be treated like objects, everything in Ruby is an object.

		<p>Ruby is a dynamic programming language. Many programming languages have a notion of "compile time" and "run time." Those are two different universes, the compiler knows completely different things than the runtime environment. Ruby, on the other hand, makes no distinction. Everything in Ruby is decided on at the last conceivable moment. If you want to call the method called foo on the object called bar, Ruby not only has to look up where this method lives, but it has to look up where the object bar lives. This is in contrast with languages like C, where the compiler knows the exact address and type of objects as well as what methods it has and their addresses.
