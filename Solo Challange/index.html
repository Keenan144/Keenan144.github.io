	<h5><p> So here it goes, my first ever blog. And without spell check might I add. But here I am halfway through my first week of Phase 0 with Dev Bootcamp. I can honestly say, "WOW" I learned so much more material in this week than I have learned in a long time. Just 4 days ago, during the Google Hangout meeting for new students, I was feeling very "unprepared" and not at all confident that I can learn this stuff. I was under the impression that, because I am a total beginner, I will be way behind on the others in my cohort. However with a good work ethic and time management, I have accomplished most all of my tasks early. I plan to have everything done on friday, this way I can review all my work. Plus with me being a beginner to almost everything here, Twitter, GitHub, Coding, Command-line, and Blogs I want to make sure I have the extra space to check for errors. Yet the work has been very straight forward, and very easy to learn with a little focus. So if you are reading this and thinking "I don't know enough to do this", well you might be right. But this school will most definitely teach you what you need to know, and they will teach you in a hurry.</p>

  <br><p> What have I learned in just four days with DBC. Well, in tech terms, I have learned how to navigate Command-line. I can push and pull from GitHub via my command line. I have learned about the differences and terms with the internet and world wide web (w3). I have created my own repository, and feel confident in sublime text editor 2. In non-tech terms, I have learned how to use the "terminal app" in my mac to make it do actual functional things. Things like create new folders, where ever I want them. Things like modify files and folders, or pull in files from the internet. I can send my own files to the internet using git (the commands) and GitHub (the hosting website). I have learned how to make useful edits and comments about those edits to share with my fellow coders. And most of all!!! I have learned how to learn! Not just sit down and memorize, no no. I have learned how to take away information from this schooling. And that my friends is gold.</p>
