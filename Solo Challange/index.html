	<h5><p> Arrays and Hashes. Different and the same. Both make life much easier for the coder. And both make inputing information easier by the bulk. But how they gather and display information is very different. Different methods of writing each, and calling each. They store information differently and present information differently. 



</p>

  <br><p> Arrays are just that, an Array. The arrays are like baskets that you can fill up. So instead of saying "I have 3 apples, 2 blankets, and passionfruite juice". You could instead say, I have a picnic. The picnic would be the array and it contains 3 apples 2 blankets and passionfruite juice. This is helpful in the code world in that I could say I have (an array) "Halo Guns" which contains all the guns from Halo, rather than saying them all out.



</p>

  <br><p> Now a hash is different, Hash is better thought of as an assignment tool. Imagine the last time you were at the DMV. You had to write out your name and other information a million times! Well not really, but in codeing big projects you might get close to it. So instead you create a hash. These are like arrays but instad of being a basket of stuff, its Garage with labled boxes. The garage (hash) could be called, Candy. And each box inside could be called different names like "sour, gummy, hot, ect." and in those boxes would be the candy like sour gummy worms or gummy bears. With a hash you can call specific elemants rather than the whole. 




</p>

  <br> <p> Hashes and arrays, dont be afraid of them. They can't hurt you......





</p>


  <br> <p> badly at least muhahahahahaha!
