	<h5><p> So earlier this week I had an issue with my ruby, actually several other students had the issue aswell. The problem was that when I would run the command "rspec", bash could not locate the gem. Even after installing the gems and looking through the type of ruby I was running, I was stuck. Everything checked out and in an online meeting "office hours" with DBC staff, we still werent so sure what was wrong. The guide in the meeting said that I might have more than one version of ruby on this new mac, and I might be running the wrong one. The it clicked, I get it. My computer has all the gems and rspec installed to a ruby. The 2.0.0-p481 that DBC has us use. However mac comes with the most up to date ruby already. So although I was using ruby, it was the wrong one.</p>

  <br><p> The fix was really easy, I went into "finder" and found the other two rubys that I had. Both were newer than the 2.0.0-p481 that DBC uses. So I went in and deleted the other files. Once I was sure I deleted the correct ones, I restarted Terminal. I opened up Siblime text, our text editor, and ran rspec. It worked!! An easy fix to an annoying problem. So to anyone with that some problem, there is one option for you to try.</p>
