> Based on the video http://vimeo.com/85001014 my impression of DBC is as follows. I feel confortable in the fact that they are not a set in stone, traditional American school. They are ever adapting and give off the vibe that they understand that, I, don't know everything about code and its totally ok. Every video I have watch, from Emotional Intelegence on, has been amazing. These people, students and teachers, are not your normal set of people. They are caring and giving and loving. They tell you what you need to know, and help you get to where you need to go.

> The video explaines how DBC is open to change, and the people there are more than willing to listen to you. The whole point behind DBC is that it is not a fixed school set in its ways. Much like coding, it is changing and adapting. Finding new ways to become better, and to produce the best developers in the world. And I'm a part of that!!!! 

> Which brings us to the next part of that... I am a part of this. And so are all the other students in my cohert. It is up to us to put on the gloves and get dirty. We are just as important to DBC's success as DBC is to us. You see DBC looks to its students for ample amounts of feed back. And they take that feed back and grow with it! Which makes DBC one of the greatest schools I have heard of in a while. And I feel priveleged to make my mark!!
